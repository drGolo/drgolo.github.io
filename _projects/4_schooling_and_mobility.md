## Overview

This research examines how education systems shape life chances and facilitate (or hinder) social mobility. Drawing on comparative education research and labour market analysis, I investigate school choice policies, transitions to work, and the relationship between educational credentials and economic outcomes.

## Key Research Questions

- **School Competition and Quality**: How do market-based education reforms affect school performance and equity?
- **Education and Labour Market Outcomes**: How do different educational pathways lead to varied labour market success?
- **Higher Education Returns**: How do returns to university education vary across subjects, institutions, and student backgrounds?
- **Educational Inequality**: How does socioeconomic background influence educational access, attainment, and labour market success?

## Major Research Projects

### The Free Schools Experiment

As co-investigator on a major Nuffield Foundation-funded study (2020-2025), I examined the competitive effects of England's free school programme on neighbouring schools. Free schools, introduced in 2010, were designed to increase parental choice and improve educational standards through market competition.

**Key Findings:**

Our research found that free schools created new competitive pressures but these related primarily to student recruitment rather than improvements in teaching quality. Specifically:

- **Attainment Effects**: No significant change in attainment for neighbouring primary schools, but modest improvements in English and Maths for neighbouring secondary schools
- **Social Segregation**: Primary free schools were associated with increased social segregation by ethnicity and income in local areas
- **Competition Mechanisms**: Nearly two-thirds of neighbouring school leaders reported competition focused on marketing and recruitment rather than teaching innovation
- **Destabilisation**: Schools serving disadvantaged communities that lost students to free schools faced potential cycles of decline

The research demonstrates that market-based reforms in education can have unintended consequences, particularly for equity and social cohesion. Our findings have informed ongoing policy debates about school choice and the role of competition in education systems.

## Research Focus Areas

### Graduate Labour Market Transitions

Examining how graduates transition into employment, the match between education and occupations, and early career progression patterns. This work connects to broader questions about graduate underemployment, skills mismatch, and whether higher education expansion has changed the value of degrees.

### Educational Inequality and Social Mobility

Investigating how socioeconomic background influences educational access, attainment, and the conversion of qualifications into labour market success. This includes analysis of:
- Widening participation in higher education
- Social class gaps in educational attainment
- The role of elite universities in social reproduction
- Intergenerational earnings mobility and the role of education

### School-to-Work Transitions

Understanding the pathways young people take from education into employment, including:
- The effectiveness of vocational and technical education routes
- Early career trajectories and job matching
- The role of careers guidance and labour market information

## Methodological Approaches

- Quasi-experimental methods to evaluate education policies
- Longitudinal cohort studies tracking education and employment trajectories
- Linked administrative data on educational attainment and earnings
- Mixed methods combining surveys, case studies, and quantitative analysis
- Comparative analysis of education systems and labour market institutions

## Policy Implications

This research informs debates about:
- School choice policies and market-based education reforms
- Effectiveness of widening participation initiatives in higher education
- Design of vocational and technical education pathways
- Links between education policy and social mobility outcomes
- The changing value of educational credentials in the labour market

## Collaborations

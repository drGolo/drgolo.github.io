## Overview

This research examines how school systems shape educational and economic inequalities. Two strands run through this work: the role of private schooling in reproducing advantage, and the effects of market-based reforms on school competition and segregation. Both address how institutional arrangements channel opportunity—who gains access to high-quality education, and what difference it makes for later outcomes.

## Research Questions

- How has access to private schooling changed as fees have risen, and what role do income and wealth play in participation?
- What are the educational, labour market, and broader life outcomes associated with private schooling in 21st century Britain?
- Do market-based education reforms improve school quality, or primarily intensify competition for students?
- How do school choice policies affect social segregation by income and ethnicity?

## Approach

This work combines longitudinal cohort studies with quasi-experimental policy evaluation. For private schooling, analysis draws on the Millennium Cohort Study and Next Steps to track outcomes from adolescence into early adulthood, comparing private and state school pupils with similar prior attainment and family backgrounds. For school competition, the Free Schools evaluation used difference-in-differences methods alongside qualitative case studies to examine how new schools affected neighbouring institutions.

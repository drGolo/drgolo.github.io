## Overview

This research examines subjective wellbeing and mental health, with particular attention to how long-term trends and economic disruptions affect different population groups. The focus is on young people's transitions through education and into work—periods when wellbeing is particularly sensitive to labour market conditions and future prospects. A key concern is understanding heterogeneity: who recovers from shocks, who doesn't, and why.

## Research Questions

- How do economic crises and labour market disruptions affect young people's mental health and life satisfaction?
- What explains variation in wellbeing trajectories—why do some individuals recover while others experience persistent difficulties?
- How do employment prospects, social connections, and future orientations shape wellbeing during periods of uncertainty?

## Approach

This work uses longitudinal data to track wellbeing over time, distinguishing temporary responses from lasting effects. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a natural experiment for studying how major disruptions propagate through different population groups. By combining high-frequency panel data with longer-running cohort studies, the research separates pandemic-specific effects from pre-existing trends in youth mental health.

## Overview

This research examines subjective wellbeing, mental health, and resilience, with particular attention to how major disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic affected different population groups. Using longitudinal data and econometric methods, I track wellbeing trajectories and identify protective and risk factors across different life stages.

## Key Research Areas

- **COVID-19 Mental Health Impact**: How did the pandemic affect mental health across different age groups, particularly young people?
- **Wellbeing Inequalities**: Which groups experienced the greatest wellbeing losses during crises, and what explains these disparities?
- **Adaptation and Resilience**: How do individuals adapt to negative shocks over time, and what factors promote resilience?

## Key Findings

My research on **COVID-19's mental health impact** challenges early narratives about universal mental health crises. While young people experienced significant deterioration in mental health during lockdowns, there was substantial heterogeneity. Some groups showed remarkable resilience, while others faced persistent difficulties.

Work on **living with COVID-19** demonstrates that as acute crisis phases ended, many individuals adapted to the "new normal," though young people's wellbeing recovery lagged behind other age groups. This highlights the importance of targeted support during extended crises.

## Methodological Contributions

- Using high-frequency longitudinal data to capture rapid wellbeing changes
- Distinguishing between temporary crisis responses and lasting mental health effects
- Examining heterogeneous treatment effects across demographic groups

## Policy Relevance

Understanding wellbeing dynamics during crises is essential for designing responsive mental health services and social support systems. The research highlights the need for:
- Age-specific mental health interventions
- Attention to cumulative disadvantage during extended disruptions
- Proactive support systems that can scale rapidly during crises

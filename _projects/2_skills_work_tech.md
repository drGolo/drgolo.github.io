## Overview

This research cluster examines graduate labour markets, skills utilisation, and technological disruption. The unifying concern is heterogeneity: higher education expansion and technological change do not affect all graduates, jobs, or skills equally. Understanding who benefits—and who doesn't—requires moving beyond average effects to examine how returns vary across fields, occupations, firms, and career paths.

## Research Questions

- How has employer demand for graduate-level skills evolved, and how well are graduates' skills actually utilised?
- What are the economic returns to STEM education, and why do they vary so much across graduates?
- Which workers and jobs are most exposed to generative AI, and what does this mean for the future of skilled work?
- When graduates earn more, is it because of what they know, what they do, or where they work?

## Approach

This work combines task-based measurement of job skill requirements with large-scale labour market data. Rather than relying on occupational titles or qualification levels, I use detailed information on what workers actually do in their jobs—drawing particularly on the Skills and Employment Survey series. For questions about STEM returns and career progression, I work with linked administrative data on education and earnings. Recent work on AI exposure applies natural language processing to measure how job tasks overlap with large language model capabilities.
